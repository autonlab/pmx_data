## Additional information
The dataset consists of sensor readings gathered from the water pump used in the Manufacturing industry.
The aim of this dataset is to give the possibility to detect any possible anomalies in the pump behaviour in order to make it possible to stop the pump before it breaks down.  This has the aim of preventing unplanned downtime and unnecessary maintenance of this machines and that further enables to receive more effective way of managing critical components 

The data consists of 54 columns:
-	1 column represent numerical data of the time (year-month-day; hour-minute-seconds) when the sensor measurement took place 
-	52 columns that represent different sensor reading values which monitor various attributes of the pump
-	1 column that represent the machine_status which gives the information about operational conditions of the pump (which might be normal, broken or recovering).

From all sensors we are given with 219,521 readings.
