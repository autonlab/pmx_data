## Additional information
Dataset Description:

The dataset is divided into 4 different subdata files saved in csv format. Each of the subdata represents different state in the machine (the dry run, base, imbalance 1 and 2). In dry run state, the records were collected when nothing was attached to drill press. In base state, the wooden base was attached to drill press In imbalance 1 state, by adding weight to one end of wooden base, the imbalance was created, whereas in imbalance 2, the imbalance was created by adding the additional weight to second end of wooden base, giving weights on both wooden base ends.

The time that is given in the data represents the time between samples. Each of the files besides the time column, consist of 4 different columns. - ax is the acceleration on x axis, - ay is the acceleration on y axis, - az is the acceleration on z axis, - aT is the G's

The sample rate at which the data was collected is at range of 100 Hz.
